def calculate_b(p_group, fp_group, ep_group):
    """
    
    The Equation determines whether the original pixel group (p_group) or the flipped pixel group (fp_group)
    is closer to the predicted pixel group (ep_group). The output 'b' is determined based on the comparison
    of the sum of absolute differences.

    Parameters:
    - p_group: list of original pixel values (p_k^(i)). 
               This is the pixel group before any modifications or bit flips.
    - fp_group: list of flipped pixel values (fp_k^(i)). 
                This is the pixel group after the t-th Least Significant Bit (LSB) has been flipped.
    - ep_group: list of predicted pixel values (ep_k^(i)). 
                This is the group of predicted pixel values obtained from the interpolation algorithm.

    Returns:
    - b: int (0 or 1) based on the following condition:
        - b = 0 if the sum of absolute differences between the original and predicted pixel groups 
          is less than or equal to the sum of absolute differences between the flipped and predicted pixel groups.
        - b = 1 otherwise.

    sum_fp_diff = 0  # Sum of |fp_k^(i) - ep_k^(i)| for the flipped pixel group

    # Step 2: Iterate over the pixel groups and calculate the absolute differences
    # We assume that the length of p_group, fp_group, and ep_group are the same

    else:
        # If the flipped group has a smaller difference, set b = 1
        return 1

# Example usage:
# p_group = [original pixel values in a group]
# fp_group = [flipped pixel values in the same group]
# ep_group = [predicted pixel values from interpolation]

# Example input (for illustration purposes):
# p_group = [120, 130, 125]  # Original pixel values
# fp_group = [121, 129, 126]  # Flipped pixel values (e.g., after LSB flip)
# ep_group = [123, 128, 126]  # Predicted pixel values (e.g., from interpolation algorithm)

# # Call the function to calculate the value of b
# b = calculate_b(p_group, fp_group, ep_group)

# # Output the result
# print(f"The calculated value of b is: {b}")
